## ✨ Features

- 📊 Accepts `cwv-scores-manual.json` generated by `cwvguard`
- 📊 Accepts a optional config array as `threshold` prop to correctly visualize your data
- 🧩 Provides a plug-and-play dashboard component (`<CWVDashboard />`)
- 📈 Displays per-route CWV scores and blocking status
- ⚡ Minimal dependency, fast loading & SSR-friendly

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install cwvdashboard
```

---

## 🔧 Setup & Integration

The dashboard reads the same `cwv-scores-manual.json` file generated by `cwvguard` or manually created.

1. Install `cwvdashboard` in your Next.js project
2. Ensure `blocked-routes.json` exists at `/public/blocked-routes.json`
3. Import and render the component in any route

---

## 🧱 Usage

### 1. Render in a route or page

```tsx
// pages/cwv.tsx or app/cwv/page.tsx

import { CwvDashboard } from 'cwvdashboard'
import cwvreport from '/public/cwv-scores-manual.json'

// this config id optional and customizable according to your requirement
const config ={
  LCP:{
    green: 2.5,
    red:4 //if value exceeds this the metric is considered breeched
  },
  FCP:{
    green: 1.8,
    red:3 //if value exceeds this the metric is considered breeched
  },
  INP:{
    green: 200,
    red:500 //if value exceeds this the metric is considered breeched
  },
  CLS:{
    green: 0.1,
    red:0.25 //if value exceeds this the metric is considered breeched
  },
  FID:{
    green: 100,
    red:300 //if value exceeds this the metric is considered breeched
  }
}

const dashboard = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CwvDashboard cwvreport={cwvreport} threshold={config}/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default dashboard
```
> Note: a default config as per the industry standards are already pre-configured, so passing this is optional
